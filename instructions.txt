Hi guys! Cornell OL, a service for finding your orientation mates, is now active. To get started, there are two simple steps:
1) Forward the email you got from your OL to addme@cornell-ol.appspotmail.com. This will add both you and your OL to the database.
2) In a day or two, head over to http://cornell-ol.appspot.com to view your orientation mates! By then, many of your orientation mates should have already put themselves in the system.
